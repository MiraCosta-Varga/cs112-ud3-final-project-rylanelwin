# Unit Deliverable 3 - Final Project

Welcome to the casino that takes all your money but gives it to charity so it's actually okay! There are many fun games such as Rock Paper Scissors, Slots, and even Blackjack! Unfortunately, there was a sinkhole that swallowed the Blackjack table, so it is currently out of order.

I didn't have any big inspirations for this project, but it's always good to remind people how easy and likely it is to lose lots of money while gambling, and I guess I did do a presentation in a psychology class about gambling addictions at one point, so that was a bit of my inspiration. It's one of the addictions people don't think about as much even though it can be just as bad or worse than more well known addictions. This game is probably more fair than most casinos since Rock Paper Scissors is an actual 50/50 chance, with the house not having an advantage.

The Blackjack table sinkhole is very sad, but I am proud of what I accomplished with everything else. I think that most of my project could've worked without using model classes, but that is just a result of the nature of what I chose to make, and the classes would've been a lot more useful if there was no GUI involved since that changes the development process a lot.

I made the wireframe a little too small for Blackjack, but the plan was to create new StackPanes that contained a rectange and a label to form a card when clicking the hit button, making sure that each new card was placed an equal amount to the right of the previous card. With better time management, I definitely think I could've got it to work the way I wanted, and I might finish it later on anyway for fun since I already got this close.
